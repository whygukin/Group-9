## Summary of the Project
In a paragraph or so, describe the main idea behind your project. Focus on the problem setup, not the
solution, i.e. what is your goal? At the very least, you should have a sentence that clearly explains
the input/output semantics of your project, i.e. what information will it take as input, and what will it
produce. Mention any applications, if any, for your project

## AI/ML Algorithms
In a single sentence, name the AI/ML algorithm(s) and method(s) you anticipate using for your project.
It does not have to be a detailed description of any algorithm, even just the name of a class of methods
is sufficient. Examples of this include “planning with dynamic programming”, “reinforcement learning
with neural function approximator”, “learning from demonstrations”, “min-max tree search with
pruning”, and so on. You can take a guess at properties of the method that you’ll prefer using, such as
model-free vs. model-based, on-policy vs. off-policy, etc. You won’t lose points for suggesting an
incorrect algorithm or method, and you’ll be able to switch to different ones at any point that it makes
sense later in the project.

## Evaluation Plan
As described in class, mention how you will evaluate the success of your project. In a paragraph, focus
on the quantitative evaluation: what are the metrics, what are the baselines, how much you expect your
approach to improve the metric by (just a ballpark is enough), what data will you evaluate on, etc. In
another paragraph, describe what qualitative analysis you will show to verify the project works, such as
what are the toy examples and sanity cases for the approach, how will you visualize the internals of the
algorithm to verify it works, what’s your moonshot case, i.e. it’ll be awesome and impressive if you get
there. Note that these are not promises, we’re not going to hold you to what you say here, but we want
you to think about the evaluation of your project in a critical manner, as you design your project and set
about performing it
